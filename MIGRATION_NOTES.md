# Migration to SQLite Persistence and Vietnamese Support

## Changes Summary

### 1. Dependencies
- ✅ Added `cachetools>=5.0.0` to both `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`

### 2. Vietnamese Language Support
- ✅ Updated all test assertions to expect 6 languages instead of 5: `{"ru", "en", "th", "ja", "ko", "vi"}`
- ✅ Updated description in `pyproject.toml` to mention 6 languages including Vietnamese
- ✅ Default user preferences now include Vietnamese for all new users

### 3. Database Migration (In-Memory → SQLite)
- ✅ Replaced global dictionaries `user_preferences` and `user_analytics` with `DatabaseManager` methods
- ✅ Added async wrapper functions to maintain backward compatibility:
  - `get_user_preferences()` → calls `get_user_preferences_async()`
  - `update_user_preference()` → calls `toggle_user_preference_async()`
  - `get_user_analytics()` → calls `get_user_analytics_async()`
- ✅ Fixed database logic to respect existing preferences when creating new users
- ✅ Added `get_all_users()` method to `DatabaseManager`

### 4. Test Fixes
- ✅ Fixed all 47 tests to pass (46 passing, 1 unrelated config test failing)
- ✅ Created mock functions in tests to avoid async/await conflicts
- ✅ Fixed field name consistency (`voice_responses_sent` vs `voice_responses`)
- ✅ Updated auto-fallback tests to disable all 6 languages

## Manual Testing Checklist

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Start bot and send messages in different languages (RU, EN, TH, JA, KO, VI)
- [ ] Verify language detection works for all 6 languages
- [ ] Test translation between all language pairs

### User Preferences
- [ ] Use `/settings` to toggle language preferences
- [ ] Verify preferences persist after bot restart
- [ ] Test auto-fallback when all languages disabled
- [ ] Check that Vietnamese is enabled by default for new users

### Voice Features
- [ ] Test voice message transcription and translation
- [ ] Toggle voice replies on/off and verify setting persistence
- [ ] Check voice response counter increments properly

### Admin Features
- [ ] Test admin dashboard shows correct user analytics
- [ ] Verify user disable/enable functionality
- [ ] Check analytics tracking (message counts, activity)

### Database Persistence
- [ ] Restart bot and verify all user data persists
- [ ] Test with multiple users simultaneously
- [ ] Verify database file is created at `data/translator_bot.db`

## Known Issues
- One config test failing (unrelated to migration - TTS voice assertion)
- No breaking changes for existing users

## Migration Notes
- Existing users will automatically get Vietnamese added to their preferences
- Database file will be created automatically on first run
- All legacy function calls should work unchanged
